# Pose_recognition
Pose recognition utilization.  
Dataset used : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niharika41298/yoga-poses-dataset (i will be specifically use downdog, plank and warrior2)   
Using mediapipe to estimate pose, a simple 1d CNN model and some basic math to calculate joint angles.   
Quite limitted (have to be parallel with the camera facing a specific direction,...)     
Too few poses but good enough to demonstrate/propose
